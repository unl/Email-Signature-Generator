# Email Signature Generator

This is a email signature generator for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
This project depends on the digital campus framework (DCF) and you will need a reference to the DCF styles
for this project to be styled correctly.

## Configuration

To configure this project you will need to find the sections of code labeled with `CONFIG FOR SIGNATURE GENERATOR`.
These sections will have color, or data values that will be specific to your University. If you do not wish to use
an email lookup API you can remove the `Email Lookup` section.
